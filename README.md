# About


P.s. :
I am not that good in PHP, so do not expect master-type codes.
This repo is supposed to work, not to be an art masterpiece. 
Thanks.

# Requirements
Ganafus SMS Gateway requires Windows (7 or above) to run. Linux and Macintosh currently not supported yet.
## Hardware
* A PC with at least dual core level processor, 1GB RAM and 300MB free disk space for MySQL and Gammu.
* A GSM Modem or GSM Phone as SMS transceiver.

## Software
* Windows 7 or above.
* Gammu SMS Gateway. To really serve SMS processing, Gammu is a must.
